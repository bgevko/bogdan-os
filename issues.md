### Issues

- HMR crashes the app when a folder is opened.
- Should set a limit to how many files can be created
- Dragging an item across a non-drop target makes the drop guide fly off screen.
- Drop guide isn't updated correctly when dragging from desktop to folder
- Background stretches on resize

### Solitaire

- Undo is done, try to implement redo as well
- Menu Bar with options to restart
- Implement a win condition
- Implement a timer
- Implement a scoring system
- Implement hard mode (3 card draw)

- Implement log mode for debugging. Each move should log the new state of the game.
