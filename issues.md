### Issues

- HMR crashes the app when a folder is opened.
- Should set a limit to how many files can be created
- Dragging an item across a non-drop target makes the drop guide fly off screen.
- Drop guide isn't updated correctly when dragging from desktop to folder
- Background stretches on resize
- Deleting an opened nested folder messes up the focus stack. Makes the parent window unclickable.
