### Tasks

### Window

- If the viewport is smaller than the Window's minimum size, a different window should render to tell the user that the given program does not support the current viewport size.
- More robust system for window position

### File Explorer

- Dragging icons from a folder to the desktop should move the icon to the desktop. Same should happen when dragging from the desktop to a folder, or from one folder to another.
- Dragging icons on top of another folder should move the icon to the folder. If the drop target is not a folder, the icon should return to its original position.
- Style the folder background
- Right clicking on a file or folder should open a context menu with options to rename, delete, and copy.
- Right clicking on the desktop / folder should open a context menu with options to create a new folder and paste.
