### Text files

- Editable text files (`.txt`)
- Support for dropping in text files from local computer

### Images

- Support for dropping in images from local computer

### System

- File renaming

  - Creating a new file should allow you to name it
  - Right clicking on a file should allow you to rename it

- Copy and paste

  - Through context menu, or through keyboard shortcuts

- File drop should have a sound

- Official apps that are not meant to be editable should be system shortcuts
  on the desktop. The file itself should be housed in a different directory

### Theme system

- Predefined themes, can be switched from the taskbar

### Solitaire

- Animations and polish
- Non-local high scores

### TODO

- Full screen mode and folders / other apps. It is assumed that only app will be in full screen mode at a time. I have to rethink this, as users can open
  other apps or directories while in full screen mode.
- Full screen mode has unnecessary grid offset on the bottom
- Full screen mode context menu is slightly too low.
- Renaming files and folders
- Update Readme
- Create a changelog
- Create sfx for droping into a folder
- Make folder being dropped into animate slightly on drop
- Make icons animate in/out when deleting/creating
- Make taskbar entry close before closing animation is complete
